        <p>3. Example: A person high in openness (imaginative, novelty-seeking, abstract) and someone extremely low in openness (practical, tradition-oriented, concrete) are basically living in different perceptual universes.

One sees possibilities.

The other sees risks.

One loves change.

The other finds comfort in stability.

Neither is “wrong”—but each is profoundly unaware of how true the opposite mindset feels to someone else.
